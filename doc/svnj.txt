OPTIONS                                                     *svnj-options*

Description:~

                                                           *'g:svnj_branch_url'*
                                                           *'g:svnj_trunk_url'*
g:svnj_branch_url
g:svnj_trunk_url

    These variable are used to retrieve the files from branches and trunk. If this option
    is set to proper value svnj shall be able to display files from the trunk and other
    branches. Helpful to diff and logs of files across branches and/or trunk.
    These values should point to the parent directory of the checkedout copy at the
    svn server  : >

        let g:svnj_branch_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches
        let g:svnj_trunk_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk
<

    Example 1:
        Lets say for a given file sample.txt
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SVN Trunk is   "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
        SVN Branch is  "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"

        The vimrc settings
        let g:svnj_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk"
        let g:svnj_branch_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches"

                                                           *'g:svnj_find_files'*
g:svnj_find_files
    This option works together with g:svnj_branch_url and g:svnj_trunk_url to 
    list files across branches and trunk . If the directory structure do not 
    match, setting this option to 1 will have svnj look for filenames using svn
    list on the required branch/trunk. Cases where same filename exists in more 
    than one directory user will be prompted to select the correct file from list
    of files.  The default value is 1, to disable code at .vimrc : >
    let g:svnj_find_files = 0
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_max_logs'*
g:svnj_max_logs
    This is used as a count of logs retrieved per revision. The default is 10
    In order to increase this value to say 20 at vimrc : >
    let g:svnj_max_logs = 20
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_max_diff'*
g:svnj_max_diff
    This is used as a count of max number of diffs at given time from SVNLog output.
    The default is 2. In order to increase this value to say 3 at vimrc : >
    let g:svnj_max_diff = 3
<
                                                           *'g:svnj_max_open_files'*
g:svnj_max_open_files
    This is used as a count of max number of files to open with open all commands
    The default is 10. In order to increase this value to say 12 at vimrc : >
    let g:svnj_max_open_files = 12
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_ignore_files'*
g:svnj_ignore_files
    This is used to ignore files for svn status, svn list and svn logs
    Default ignore list is ['.pyc', '.bin', '.egg', '.so', '*.rpd']
       
    To ignore files with extension .class, .obj at vimrc code : >
    let g:svnj_ignore_files = ['.class', '.obj']
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_fuzzy_search'*
g:svnj_fuzzy_search
    A fuzzy search at filter prompt is available if vim is compiled with support
    for python. By default this is enabled if python exists. To disable this 
    feature use this variable, 
    Value 1 : enables fuzzy search (default)
    Value 0 : disables fuzzy search
    At .vimrc example : >
    let g:svnj_fuzzy_search = 0
<

                                                *'g:svnj_fuzzy_search_result_max'*
g:svnj_fuzzy_search_result_max
    A fuzzy search at filter prompt is available if vim is compiled with support
    for python. Look for |g:svnj_fuzzy_search| for more info.
    This variable is used to display the max results matched from search, the default
    is 50. 
    At .vimrc example : >
    let g:svnj_fuzzy_search_result_max = 60
<

MAPPINGS                                                   *svnj-mappings*

                                                    *'g:svnj_allow_leader_mappings'*

Use this option to allow default mappings. The dafault value for this is 0 : >
    let g:svnj_allow_leader_mappings = 1
<
    With above value set the following are default mappings
    map <silent> <leader>b :SVNBlame<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>c :SVNCommits<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>d :SVNDiff<CR>

    + Added SVNList
    + Added SVNListRec
    + Added Fuzzy search at filter (Credits: Method pyMatch copied and modified from : Alexey Shevchenko
