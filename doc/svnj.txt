OPTIONS                                                     *svnj-options*

Description:~

                                                           *'g:svnj_branch_url'*
                                                           *'g:svnj_trunk_url'*
g:svnj_branch_url
g:svnj_trunk_url

    These variable are used to retrieve the files from branches and trunk. If this option
    is set to proper value svnj shall be able to display files from the trunk and other
    branches. Helpful to diff and logs of files across branches and/or trunk.
    These values should point to the parent directory of the checkedout copy at the
    svn server  : >

        let g:svnj_branch_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches
        let g:svnj_trunk_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk
<

    Example 1:
        Lets say for a given file sample.txt
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SVN Trunk is   "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
        SVN Branch is  "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"

        The vimrc settings
        let g:svnj_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk"
        let g:svnj_branch_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches"

                                                           *'g:svnj_find_files'*
g:svnj_find_files
    This option works together with g:svnj_branch_url and g:svnj_trunk_url to 
    list files across branches and trunk . If the directory structure do not 
    match, setting this option to 1 will have svnj look for filenames using svn
    list on the required branch/trunk. Cases where same filename exists in more 
    than one directory user will be prompted to select the correct file from list
    of files.  The default value is 1, to disable code at .vimrc : >
    
    let g:svnj_find_files = 0
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_max_logs'*
g:svnj_max_logs
    This is used as a count of logs retrieved per revision. The default is 10
    In order to increase this value to say 20 at vimrc : >
    let g:svnj_max_logs = 20
<
                                                           *'g:svnj_ignore_files'*
g:svnj_ignore_files
    This is used to ignore files for svn status, svn list and svn logs
    Default ignore list is ['.pyc', '.bin', '.egg', '.so', '*.rpd']
       
    To ignore files with extension .class, .obj at vimrc code : >
    let g:svnj_ignore_files = ['.class', '.obj']
<

MAPPINGS                                                   *svnj-mappings*

Description:~
                                                    *'g:svnj_allow_leader_mappings'*

Use this option to allow default mappings. The dafault value for this is 0 : >
    let g:svnj_allow_leader_mappings = 1
<
    With above value set the following are default mappings
    map <silent> <leader>b :SVNBlame<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>c :SVNCommits<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>d :SVNDiff<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>s :SVNStatus<CR>  
    map <silent> <leader>su :SVNStatus<CR>  
    map <silent> <leader>sq :SVNStatus u q<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>sp :SVNStatus u py<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>l :SVNLog<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>L :SVNList<CR>
    map <silent> <leader>q :diffoff! <CR> :q<CR>
