  While browsing the repo/working copy you can bookmarks the dir/files with Ctrl-b
  key. All of the book marked files will be listed here. All of the browsing options
  are again valid. These bookmarked files/dirs are available only for the current
  vim session unless caching is enabled, Once vim is closed all bookmarks are lost. 
  If you need some of the dirs/files as bookmarks across sessions without enabling
  the caching use the mylist opiton i,e |SVNBrowseMyList| and code in .vimrc the 
  |g:svnj_browse_mylist| with values as mentioned in the description of
  |g:svnj_browse_mylist|

This command clears all cached files. The caching is not enabled by default. 
Please look at
 |g:svnj_browse_cache_all|
 |g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache|
 |g:svnj_browse_repo_cache|
 |g:svnj_browse_workingcopy_cache|
 |g:svnj_cache_dir|
 |g:svnj_browse_max_files_cnt| and 
 |g:svnj_browse_repo_max_files_cnt| for more info. 

NOTE on UNIX/OSX setting |g:svnj_browse_cache_all| to 1 will enable all
of the feature. The rest of the options can be used to fine grain to the need.
Example at .vimrc >

  let g:svnj_browse_cache_all = 1

OPTIONS                                                     *svnj-options*

Description:~

                                                           *'g:svnj_trunk_url'*
This variable along with |g:svnj_branch_url| are used to retrieve the files from 
branches and trunk for |SVNLog| command. If these option are set to proper values
svnj shall be able to display files from the trunk and other branches. Helpful to
diff and logs of files across branches and/or trunk.

For in depth |g:svnj_branch_url| option look further down at |g:svnj_branch_url|
description where multiple branches/directories can now be specified. These values
should point to the parent directory of the checkedout copy at the svn server 

|g:svnj_trunk_url| do not support coma separated values
|g:svnj_branch_url| does support coma separated values
>
    let g:svnj_branch_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches
    let g:svnj_trunk_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk
<

Example 1:
  Lets say for a given file sample.txt
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SVN Trunk is  "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  SVN Branch is "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  
  The vimrc settings
  let g:svnj_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk"
  let g:svnj_branch_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches"

                                                           *'g:svnj_branch_url'*
This option is used to specify the branch details for use with |SVNLog| command,
This option takes in coma separated svn urls for branches/directories. 
A simple example is given along with the |g:svnj_trunk_url| description. 
Even if there is only one url that has all the branches providing in depth directories
here will help narrow down the file searches during file look ups

  Lets say for a given file sample.txt
  SVN Branch is "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  at the server.
  
  The following entries are valid for |g:svnj_branch_url| >
  
  let g:svnj_branch_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches,
                          \ svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1,
                          \ svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1,
                          \ svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2"
<

  (NOTE: The "\" at the second, third and fourth line lets vim know that it is a 
   continuation of the same string)
  
  With above values, when option to list branches for sample.txt is chosen 
  The branches menu will display all of the 4 options specified above. Selecting 
  say the last option "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2"
  and pressing Enter will search for the files from the directory onwards to be more
  specific the command used will be
  svn list -r svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2 
  The advantage of this would be the faster retrieval of files.
  
  It is not required to have the same root. If the branches are in different 
  locations, continue adding those with coma seperations. 


                                                           *'g:svnj_browse_mylist'*
This option is used with |SVNBrowseMyList| command. If this option is not specified,
|SVNBrowseMyList| will start at the current working directory. The contents should
be list of directories/files with absolue path. It can be a string with coma 
separated directories/files or a list of directories/files.
Use this as a permanent book mark to browse quickly.  

NOTE : 1. The directories should end with a "/" 
       2. The files should not end with a "/"  >

  let g:svnj_browse_mylist = ["svn://127.0.0.1/Root", "/home/user/myproject/core/",
                             \  "/home/user/myfile.txt"]
                    OR
  let g:svnj_browse_mylist = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root, /home/user/myproject/core/,
                             \ /home/user/myfile.txt"
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_find_files'*
This option works together with g:svnj_branch_url and g:svnj_trunk_url to list 
files across branches and trunk . If the directory structure do not match, 
setting this option to 1 will have svnj look for filenames using svn list on
the required branch/trunk. Look at |g:svnj_branch_url| to narrow down the search
path. The files are searched using 
 svn list -R  command.
Cases where same filename exists in more than one directory user will be prompted 
to select the correct file from list of files.  
The default value is 1, to disable code at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_find_files = 0
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_warn_log'*
This is used to warn user when |g:svnj_find_files| is enabled (which is a 
default behavior) and while finding files across branches/trunk the directory
stucture does not match and svnj tries to find file by recursively listing all
files from the root of the branch/trunk selected and ends up recieving lots of 
files. Cases like this where branch directories do not match it is better to list
directories at |g:svnj_branch_url| just to minimize the traffic between the client
and server. The warn message can be disabled by coding at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_warn_log = 0
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_max_logs'*
This is used as a count of logs retrieved per revision. The default is 10
In order to increase this value to say 20 at .vimrc >
    let g:svnj_max_logs = 20
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_max_diff'*
This is used as a count of max number of diffs at given time from SVNLog output.
The default is 2. In order to increase this value to say 3 at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_max_diff = 3
<
                                                           *'g:svnj_max_open_files'*
This is used as a count of max number of files to open with open all commands
The default is 10. In order to increase this value to say 12 at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_max_open_files = 12
<

                                                           *'g:svnj_ignore_files'*
This is used to ignore files for svn status, svn list and svn logs
Default ignore list is  ['.pyc', '.bin', '.zip', '.egg', '.so', '.rpd', '.git',
     '.png', '.psd', '.gif', '.jpg', '.ico', '.pdf']

A fuzzy search at filter prompt is available if vim is compiled with support
for python. By default this is enabled if python exists. To disable this 
feature use this variable, 
Value 1 : enables fuzzy search (default) or Value 0 : disables fuzzy search
At .vimrc code >

python. Look for |g:svnj_fuzzy_search| for more info.  This variable is used to
display the max results matched from search, the default is 50. 
At .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_fuzzy_search_result_max = 60
<

                                                                *'g:svnj_signs'*
When the files/revisions are marked a sign is placed on the marked/selected lines.
This feature can be disabled using this opton. The default behavior enables this 
feature. A value 1 is enable and value 0 is disable. Vim should have signs enabled
To disable signs, at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_signs = 0 
To enable it (default), at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_signs = 1
<
                                                            *'g:svnj_cache_dir'*
This is the directory where the cached information will be stored. This option
is required for windows. On MAC/Unix the default location is $HOME/.cache.
A new directory svnj will be created in the specified directory. For more info
about cache look at |g:svnj_browse_cache_all| , |g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt|

To change the location of the storing the cache info at .vimrc code >
  let g:svnj_cache_dir="/path/to/cache"
<

NOTE: For windows this option must be specified. Example say we want to specify
the home directory of user1
>
  let g:svnj_cache_dir="C:/Users/user1"
< 

                                           *'g:svnj_browse_cache_all'*
                                           *'g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache'*
                                           *'g:svnj_browse_repo_cache'*
                                           *'g:svnj_browse_workingcopy_cache'*

Caching of file/directories retrived from the repositoy, working copy or bookmarks
is not cached by default. Enabling this feature will help increase the speed of
listing the files during browse operations. Enabling the caching of bookmarks
enables the bookmarks to be available across all vim sessions. 
When these options are enabled the retrieved info as said below

|g:svnj_browse_repo_cache| - File/Directory names retrieved from SVN while
                           performing a recursive list of repository

|g:svnj_browse_workingcopy_cache| - File/Directory names retrieved from the
                           local/working copy for recursive listing

|g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache|  - The bookmarked files/dirs

will be cached at default $HOME.cache.svnj directory or the direcory specified
by |g:svnj_cache_dir| option . The number of files stored can be controlled by 
|g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt| The |g:svnj_browse_cache_all| will enable all 
caching and hence no need to specify the other cache options mentioned

example at .vimrc to enable all caching >
  let g:svnj_browse_cache_all = 1 
<

example at .vimrc to enable bookmarks caching only >
  let g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache = 1 
<

                                            *'g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt'*
The options is used for caching. This specifies the number of files that 
can be stored in the cache. Each file contains the listing of each 
independent directory. The default value is 20. In order to increase this
at .vimrc code >
  let g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt = 50
<

                                            *'g:svnj_browse_repo_max_files_cnt'*
This option specifies the maximum number of files to be fetched during 
|SVNBrowseRepo| command while recursive. The default value is 1000. If the 
caching is enabled its bettter to increase this value. To change this value 
to say 2000 code at .vimrc >
  let g:svnj_browse_repo_max_files_cnt = 2000
<

                                              *'g:svnj_browse_max_files_cnt'*
This option specifies the maximum number of files to be fetched during 
|SVNBrowseWorkingCopy| command while recursive. The default value is 10000. If the 
caching is enabled its bettter to increase this value. To change this value 
to say 20000 code at .vimrc >
  let g:svnj_browse_max_files_cnt = 20000

v0.1~
  + Initial Revision

v0.2~
  + Enhanced file lookup across branches and trunk. 
    When directory structure across branches do not match and when more than one 
    candidate is available in the lookup branch, the list of files are displayed
    for selecting the proper file.

v0.3~
  + Added Fuzzy search at filter (Credits: Method pyMatch copied and modified from:
      Alexey Shevchenko Userid FelikZ/ctrlp-py-matcher from github)
  + Added SVNList
  + Added SVNListRec
  + Stream lined operations
  + Added option to open files without splits

v0.4~
  + Added support to browse the entire svn using |SVNBrowse| command
  + Added support to browse the working directory using |SVNBrowseWorkingCopy| command
  + Added support for permanent bookmarks see g:svnj_browse_mylist
  + Added support for multiple branches at g:svnj_branch_url 
        - Hint svn tag  
  + Added support to navigate entire SVN without any configuration
     NOTE: Using configuration options like g:svnj_browse_mylist and g:svnj_branch_url
           will help navigate faster.  Again g:svnj_branch_url supports coma seperated 
           directories
  + Added sign(s) for file/logs selection
  + Added support for customization 
     use    :help svnj-customize
  + Added following Key Mapping

        |Ctrl-u|  : Go up
  + Added more files to ignore list
  - Removed |SVNList|, |SVNListRec| in favor of SVNBrowse and SVNBrowseWorkingCopy and
    more

   Known Issue.
   1. Marking/Selecting the file/directory using Ctrl-Space highlights the line
      Later navigating away from the path say going up the directory and recusrive list
      of contents donot highlights the line though remembers the marked file and open/diffs
      the file. (Will Fix later)

v0.5~

  FIXED:
  + statusline getting disappeared in few scenarios 
  
  ENHANCEMENTS:

  + Added BrowseWorkingCopyRec
     - This command recusrively lists file, avoids a few key strokes

  + BrowseWorkingCopy[Rec] command now works for local files/directories also,
     The svn commands like show logs will report error if the selected entry is not
     an svn entity, Other operations like open should work

  + Supported Ctrl-Enter for BrowseMenu on Repo and Workingcopy , saves again few keystorkes

  + OpenAll [Ctrl-o ] operation in case of Browse, Status and Commits will honor the filter,
    Files shown only on the buffer will be candidates to be opened

  + Added Ctrl-i for browsed and stats file, this lists the svn info of file/dir

  + Enhanced file fetcher, limits the depth/number of files fetched

  + status line shows number for files selected/marked

  + Added more customization options
     g:svnj_custom_statusbar_ops_hl, g:svnj_custom_statusbar_ops_hide,
     g:svnj_custom_statusbar_sel_hl

v0.6~

  ADDITIONS:

  + Support for WINDOWS (tested on vim 7.4 should work from 7.0)
  + Support fuzzy with out python  
  + Support for caching - helps improve speed while doing svn files retrieval
    Only for browsing files

  + Affected files operation for SVNBrowse, SVNLog and SVNCommits. THIS IS GOOD :)
    |Ctrl-a| brings up the affected files for the selected revision.  It is available for
    the outputs of browsing and log. Selecting more than one will diff the selected revisions
    and brings out the changed/affected files across the revisions.

  + Added Ctrl-y which will display the svn cmd used. If a better cmd/opt can be used let me
    know

  + Added SVNClearCache to clear all cached info

  + Added command SVNInfo

  ENHANCEMENTS:

  + SVNCommits now accepts directories.  A '.' will be expanded to the current directory
  + SVNLog now accepts directories or files.
  + SVNStatus now accepts directories.
  + SVNBrowseRepo now accepts "/" and start browsing from the root of repository
  + SVNBrowseRepo, SVNBrowseWorkingCopy, SVNBrowseBookMarks now can be cached
     NOT Enabled by default. Need to enable this see :help SVNClearCache
  + SVNBrowseRepo, SVNBrowseWorkingCopy now has Ctrl-r to refresh, recreates cache
  + SVNBrowseWorkingCopy, SVNBrowseRepo recursive listing can now be controlled using
    g:svnj_browse_max_files_cnt and g:svnj_browse_repo_max_files_cnt

  FIXED
  + Highlighting of Mark/Selected file 
  + Diff when browsing local files
