  line listing the file from the commit log. Ctrl-s is the key to commit and
  Ctrl-q is to quit from with in the commit log.
  SVNCommits is the command to list all commit/checkins performed. All/most of
  the operations of SVNCommits can now be done using SVNLog. SVNCommits will
  later be removed.

  |g:svnj_fuzzy_search_result_max|, |g:svnj_signs|, |g:svnj_sticky_on_start|

  Examples:~

  + To list the affected files in current dir
    :SVNLog .  
    Go to required revision and press Ctrl-a

  + To list the affected files from subdirectories of current working dir
    :SVNLog directory
    Go to required revision and press Ctrl-a

  + To see the log of file in buffer
    :SVNLog

  + To see the log of file not in buffer
    :SVNLog path/to/file

  + To see all commits from the day the branch was created
     :SVNLog .
      -  Look at the status bar for current revision as "@" and
      branch created revision as "S@"
      - Can use 2 options to list
       1. Select the revision shown at S@ and press Ctrl-h
                 or
       2. Select the current revision and S@ revision and press Enter
          This works for directories only

  + How to use sticky and Ctrl-q 
    Added Ctrl-q to the files diffed from SVNJWindow. Press Ctrl-q on the diffed
    file if the sticky is enabled on svnj window, the control/cursor will land back
    on the svnj window.  Very helpfull when need to diff/compare a few versions for
    a given file. Here is the scenario.

    1. SVNLog <filename>  20   
        The above command opens 20 logs for the given filename if provided else
        takes any file in buffer. If no file in buffer will log for current directory

   2. Press Ctrl-s on svnj window.  STICKY should be displayed on the status line

   3. Take the cursor to the requiered revision line and Press Enter.
       The revision will be diffed with the file in buffer. 
       Perform any operations needed there.  And make sure the cursor when done is
       on the buffer which was last opened

   4. Press Ctrl-q
      This will end the diff session and control back to svnj window
      repeat again from Step 3.
     
   5. Added "?" as help display supported operations. Disable the operations using 
      let g:svnj_custom_statusbar_ops_hide = 1
      and then use ? to bring out the supported operations for a quick glance

AUTHENTICATION                                              *svnj-authentication*

Description:~

When username/passwords are stored locally and not provided for the commands 
against SVN then no need to set any info for SVNJ. However cases where the 
username/passwords are chosen not to be stored locally and you have been providing
the authentication with the required commands then the username/password will be 
required for commands (example  svn log, commit etc.,)

SVNJ supports SVN authentications to be supplied by either the settings or when an
command fails due to authentication error.

Providing the info from settings (.vimrc) requires that the username/password in
plain text, If this is not desired SVNJ will prompt for the username/password 
when a commands fails with authentication error. The username/password provided
will be cached locally and will be available only for the current vim session 
(i,e new vim window will request auth again when a command fails authentication)

The following are the settings available


                                                        *'g:svnj_username'*
This option is used to store the svn username example at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_username="user1"
<

                                                         *'g:svnj_password'*
This option is used to store the svn password example at .vimrc code >
    let g:svnj_password="passwordforuser1"
<

                                                     *'g:svnj_auth_disable'*
This option is used to disable the feature. SVNJ will not prompt for username
and password even if the command fails authentication, The default is 0.

OPTIONS                                                     *svnj-options*

Description:~

This variable along with |g:svnj_branch_url| are used to retrieve the files from 
branches and trunk for |SVNLog| command. If these option are set to proper values
svnj shall be able to display files from the trunk and other branches. Helpful to
diff and logs of files across branches and/or trunk.

For in depth |g:svnj_branch_url| option look further down at |g:svnj_branch_url|
description where multiple branches/directories can now be specified. These values
should point to the parent directory of the checkedout copy at the svn server 

|g:svnj_trunk_url| do not support coma separated values
|g:svnj_branch_url| does support coma separated values
>
    let g:svnj_branch_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches
    let g:svnj_trunk_url = svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk
<

Example 1:
  Lets say for a given file sample.txt
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SVN Trunk is  "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  SVN Branch is "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  
  The vimrc settings
  let g:svnj_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/trunk"
  let g:svnj_branch_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches"

                                                           *'g:svnj_branch_url'*
This option is used to specify the branch details for use with |SVNLog| command,
This option takes in coma separated svn urls for branches/directories. 
A simple example is given along with the |g:svnj_trunk_url| description. 
Even if there is only one url that has all the branches providing in depth directories
here will help narrow down the file searches during file look ups

  Lets say for a given file sample.txt
  SVN Branch is "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2/sample.txt"
  at the server.
  
  The following entries are valid for |g:svnj_branch_url| >
  
  let g:svnj_branch_url = ["svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches",
                          \ "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1",
                          \ "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1",
                          \ "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2"]
<

  (NOTE: The "\" at the second, third and fourth line lets vim know that it is a 
   continuation of the same string)
  
  With above values, when option to list branches for sample.txt is chosen 
  The branches menu will display all of the 4 options specified above. Selecting 
  say the last option "svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2"
  and pressing Enter will search for the files from the directory onwards to be more
  specific the command used will be
  svn list -r svn://127.0.0.1/Root/branches/example_branch1/dir1/dir2 
  The advantage of this would be the faster retrieval of files.
  
  It is not required to have the same root. If the branches are in different 
  locations, continue adding those with coma seperations. 


                                                           *'g:svnj_browse_mylist'*
This option is used with |SVNBrowseMyList| command. If this option is not specified,
|SVNBrowseMyList| will start at the current working directory. The contents should
be list of directories/files with absolue path. It can be a string with coma 
separated directories/files or a list of directories/files.
Use this as a permanent book mark to browse quickly.  

NOTE : 1. The directories should end with a "/" 
       2. The files should not end with a "/"  >

This is the directory where the cached information will be stored. This option
is required for windows. On MAC/Unix the default location is $HOME/.cache.
A new directory svnj will be created in the specified directory. For more info
about cache look at |g:svnj_browse_cache_all| , |g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt|

To change the location of the storing the cache info at .vimrc code >
  let g:svnj_cache_dir="/path/to/cache"
<

NOTE: For windows this option must be specified. Example say we want to specify
the home directory of user1
>
  let g:svnj_cache_dir="C:/Users/user1"

Caching of file/directories retrived from the repositoy, working copy or bookmarks
is not cached by default. Enabling this feature will help increase the speed of
listing the files during browse operations. Enabling the caching of bookmarks
enables the bookmarks to be available across all vim sessions. 
When these options are enabled the retrieved info as said below

|g:svnj_browse_repo_cache| - File/Directory names retrieved from SVN while
                           performing a recursive list of repository

|g:svnj_browse_workingcopy_cache| - File/Directory names retrieved from the
                           local/working copy for recursive listing

|g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache|  - The bookmarked files/dirs

will be cached at default $HOME.cache.svnj directory or the direcory specified
by |g:svnj_cache_dir| option . The number of files stored can be controlled by 
|g:svnj_browse_cache_max_cnt| The |g:svnj_browse_cache_all| will enable all 
caching and hence no need to specify the other cache options mentioned

example at .vimrc to enable all caching >

CHANGELOG                                           *svnj-changelog*

v0.1~
  + Initial Revision

v0.2~
  + Enhanced file lookup across branches and trunk. 
    When directory structure across branches do not match and when more than one 
    candidate is available in the lookup branch, the list of files are displayed
    for selecting the proper file.

v0.3~
  + Added Fuzzy search at filter (Credits: Method pyMatch copied and modified from:
      Alexey Shevchenko Userid FelikZ/ctrlp-py-matcher from github)
  + Added SVNList
  + Added SVNListRec
  + Stream lined operations
  + Added option to open files without splits

v0.4~
  + Added support to browse the entire svn using |SVNBrowse| command
  + Added support to browse the working directory using |SVNBrowseWorkingCopy| command
  + Added support for permanent bookmarks see g:svnj_browse_mylist
  + Added support for multiple branches at g:svnj_branch_url 
        - Hint svn tag  
  + Added support to navigate entire SVN without any configuration
     NOTE: Using configuration options like g:svnj_browse_mylist and g:svnj_branch_url
           will help navigate faster.  Again g:svnj_branch_url supports coma seperated 
           directories
  + Added sign(s) for file/logs selection
  + Added support for customization 
     use    :help svnj-customize
  + Added following Key Mapping 
        |Ctrl-t|  : Go to start
        |Ctrl-u|  : Go up
  + Added more files to ignore list
  - Removed |SVNList|, |SVNListRec| in favor of SVNBrowse and SVNBrowseWorkingCopy and
    more

   Known Issue.
   1. Marking/Selecting the file/directory using Ctrl-Space highlights the line
      Later navigating away from the path say going up the directory and recusrive list
      of contents donot highlights the line though remembers the marked file and open/diffs
      the file. (Will Fix later)

v0.5~

  FIXED:
  + statusline getting disappeared in few scenarios 
  
  ENHANCEMENTS:

  + Added BrowseWorkingCopyRec
     - This command recusrively lists file, avoids a few key strokes

  + BrowseWorkingCopy[Rec] command now works for local files/directories also,
     The svn commands like show logs will report error if the selected entry is not
     an svn entity, Other operations like open should work
