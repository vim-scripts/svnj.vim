1. SVNAdd [<file>|<dir>|%]
    Add and Commit File(s)/Directories to svn repo. SVNAdd is supported as a command and also as an
    operation from SVNStatus and SVNBrowse output. Available options are to just add or add and commit 

2. SVNCommit[!] [<file>|<dir>|%]
     Performs svn commit. A new buffer will be opened to accept comments. The buffer will list
     the files which are candidates for commit. Files/Directories can also be updated in this buffer. 
     A commit can be forced with no comments with a bang. SVNCommit is supported as a command and 
     also as an operation from the SVNStatus|SVNBrowseWorkingCopy|SVNBrowseBuffer output window. 

3. SVNBlame [<file>|<dir>|%]
     Vertically splits the blame info for the file in bufffer. Scrollbinds to the file.

4. SVNStatus [ <dir> | . [q] [u]]
     Get the output of svn status. With the listed files in the split buffer which states the filename
     and status, the following are few of the operations supported
       - Open file under cursor or all 
       - SVN info, SVN Diff 
       - SVN Commit selected/marked files, opens a commit log for accepting comments (svn ci)
       - SVN Add selected/marked files as new repo elements (svn add)

5. SVNLog [<file> | <dir> | . | % [,nooflogs]]
     Lists the log for the current file in buffer.  The output displays the revision, author, comments 
     and the revision when the branch was created. With the revisions listed can diff the required 
     revisions with the file in buffer. Also provides mechanism to diff the file across branches/trunk. 
     A menu will be displayed to list revisions from available branches and trunk. This requires that
     g:svnj_branch_url and g:svnj_trunk_url be defined. 

     - Diff revision(s) from current working copy or across branches/trunk
     - List Affected/Modified files for the revision (most useful with dirs)
     - SVN Diff :HEAD | :PREV  with selected revision (most useful with dirs)
     - Open marked revisons or revison under cursor as new file - newbuffer or vspilt
     - View SVN Info and Log of revision

6. SVNDiff
   Immediate diff the file in buffer with the previous revision. If there are more than one file in 
   buffer Ctrl-n/Ctrl-p will close the current diff and move to the next/prev file in buffer.

7. SVNBrowse
   Browse the svn repository, working copy files, buffer files, favorites, bookmarks

     - SVNBrowse
         This command brings up a menu of available options for browsing.
     - SVNBrowseRepo [<dir>|/]
         This command lists files/directories from the repository. The current directory should be 
         a working copy for the plugin to pick up the svn path.
     - SVNBrowseWorkingCopy [<dir>]
         This command lists files/directories from the current directory. 
     - SVNBrowseMyList
         This command lists files/directories specified using g:svnj_browse_mylist see 
         :help g:svnj_browse_mylist 
     - SVNBrowseBookMarks
           While browsing the repo/working copy you can bookmarks the dir/files 
           All of the book marked files will be listed as output. 
           These bookmarked files/dirs are available only for the current vim session unless caching 
           is enabled, Once vim is closed all bookmarks are lost if caching is not enabled.
     -SVNBrowseBuffer
           List the files from Buffer

     Cache for browsing:
         The caching feature is off by default, On enabling the caching the listing of files for 
     SVNBrowseRepo and SVNBrowseWorkingCopy will be faster. There are many levels at which the caching
     can be enabled see help:g:svnj_cache_dir

    Some of the operations supported are
      - Recursive/Non-recursive listing of files from directory
      - Open file(s) in new buffer or vertical split
      - Navigate up/down the directory, Jump to Respository Root/Working Root/Home where applicable
      - SVN info, SVN Log
      - Bookmark the dir/file. To persist the bookmarks across sessions see :help g:svnj_browse_bookmarks_cache
      - SVN Checkout (svn co)
          Hint : Use Bookmarks or MyList feature to store the repo root so that can be browsed 
                 when need to checkout.  
      - SVN Copy (Paste) the selected urls to new dir location, (svn cp)
          The paste on repo requires a commit so a buffer will be opened to enter comments for the commit
      - SVN Add, SVN Commit

 8. SVNCommits [ <dir> | . | [,nooflogs]]
      Get the list of files checked in across project revision. This command lists the output of svn log 
      of the project directory.

     The cache/persistency is not enabled by default. please see :help SVNClearCache for more info.

10. SVNInfo [<file> | <dir> | % | . ]
     Will display svn info.

Recomended settings at .vimrc

let g:svnj_custom_statusbar_ops_hide = 1
    Supported operations are listed on the status line of the svnj_window. With growing support for
    many commands, recomend to hide it. You can still have a quick glance of supported operations by
    pressing ?

let g:svnj_browse_cache_all = 1
    This enables caching, Listing of files will be faster, On MAC/Unix the default location is $HOME/.cache.
    A new directory svnj will be created in the specified directory.

    For windows this option must be specified along with the cache dir
    let g:svnj_cache_dir="C:/Users/user1"

let g:svnj_branch_url = ["svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches/", "svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/tags/"]
    This settings when available will provide menu's to navigate available branches and tags for SVNLog

let g:svnj_trunk_url = "svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/trunk";
    This settings when available will provide menu's to navigate trunk files for SVNLog
